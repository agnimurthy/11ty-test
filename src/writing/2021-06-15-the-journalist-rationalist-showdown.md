Here’s a quick after-action report on the [journalist-rationalist showdown](https://graymirror.substack.com/p/scott-alexander-the-disappointed)—with some light deconstruction of the posts by our stars, [Scott Alexander](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/statement-on-new-york-times-article) and [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5310). Again, I think these guys are two of the top working intellectuals in the world today, so I’m perfectly comfortable in judging them by the highest possible bar.

Let’s start by praising the Scotts, for saying cogent things like [this](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5310) (Aaronson):

> Last night, it occurred to me that despite how disjointed it feels, the _New York Times_ piece does have a central thesis: namely, that rationalism is a “gateway drug” to dangerous beliefs. And that thesis is 100% correct—insofar as _once you teach people that they can think for themselves about issues of consequence, some of them might think bad things_. It’s just that many of us judge the benefit worth the risk!

And if that’s all you know about this tempest in a teapot—it’s all you _need_ to know. Both Scotts are like this. They can dominate the forecourt with these massive [serves](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/statement-on-new-york-times-article):

> I don’t want to accuse the _New York Times_ of _lying_ about me, exactly, but if they were truthful, it was in the same way as that famous movie review which describes the Wizard of Oz as: “Transported to a surreal landscape, a young girl kills the first person she meets and then teams up with three strangers to kill again.”

Do you want to get in an argument with a person who can express himself like this? Not on a level playing field, you don’t. And yet: both their backhands are a _mess_.

And I feel equipped to coach them (in this very specialized subfield of PR, dissident PR, in which the goal is to _not_ get press) _not_ because I have never made any mistakes—but because I am pretty sure I have made _all_ the mistakes.

I have certainly made all the mistakes they just made! So I can try to explain how to process the consequences. (My other credential is that right now I have a bunch of press asking why I haven’t gotten any press since 2014. That’ll die down too, I think. Glen Weyl is right: you’re just not doing the Party a favor by giving me attention.)

Most people I know think the rationalists, and decent people everywhere, won here. My view is different. Real victories are not so cheap. When you win one, you’ll know. But as always, dear rationalists: _all that matters is whether or not you update your priors_.

## Power and the quokka

The worldview of the early 21st-century intellectual, rationalists included, is one in which _power does not exist_. This is like fish not believing in water. It mostly works, but eventually the fish start having to invent epicycles to explain things like “the tide.”

The purpose of government is to create the illusion that power does not exist. It does this by maintaining a monopoly of power. It’s perfectly safe to touch a high-voltage wire as long as you’re also not touching the ground. So: don’t touch the ground.

When government breaks down, it goes bad in two ways. One is _anarchy_—which is not the absence of power, but the absence of a _monopoly_ of power. Since nature abhors a vacuum, bubbles of _alternate_ power soon begin to form. We call these bubbles _crime_. Crime is always and everywhere a case of _nano-government:_ a “pop-up regime” whose boundaries in space and time may be measured in meters and minutes.

The other way government breaks down is called _tyranny_. A tyranny is a monopoly of power in which stray power is everywhere—habitually shocking you when it doesn’t need to. Of course, if you _do_ touch the ground—or even just _point_ at it—zap.

You would think that, anarchy and tyranny being logical opposites, there would be a Goldilocks effect and a happy medium. But they often [travel together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_T._Francis#:~:text=Francis's%20term%20%22anarcho%2Dtyranny%22,to%20enforce%20fundamental%20protective%20law.). As anyone with an aging body knows, when complex systems fail, they tend to fail in _both_ directions. In some cases, this is called “California.”

The quokka is a rare marsupial that lives on a predator-free island—and has become famous as the nicest mammal on earth. Here is a nice rationalist quokka, saying hi:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc880cf08-071a-4b2e-918e-88e4ae51f23f_641x506.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc880cf08-071a-4b2e-918e-88e4ae51f23f_641x506.png)

Hi, nice quokka! What happens when a nice quokka says hi to a… red fox? We just found out. It is especially important to note that _foxes aren’t evil_—they are just foxes.

The relationship between predators and prey, so basic to everyone who grows up in a food chain, is entirely lost on this little bundle of joy. But of course, there is tension in quokka society—I believe they’re all polyamorists, in fact—and, like all of life on earth, they do experience conflict. They probably _nip_ each other, or something.

Presumably, when the quokka meets the fox, he interprets the fox in quokka terms. This funny-looking quokka is super mad at him. Why? Did he borrow the dude’s lady? Maybe she’s funny-looking too—has he done it with one of these foxy red quokkas? Wait—_no!_

What we see in the rationalists is a failure to understand the nature, purpose and meaning of journalism—which is only a small part of their failure to understand the nature, purpose and meaning of _power_.

Unfortunately, our monopoly of power is not in the best of health—so we see a lot of anarchy, and a good bit of tyranny. In such times it is good to understand such things.

You can’t have a normal human conversation with an on-duty cop, any more than a quokka can have a normal quokka conversation with a fox. The fox is a predator; the cop is an instrument of power. And so is a journalist. Either may want to “chat” with you—a conversation which, if you _have_ to have it, demands quite a different skill set.

The rationalist has never even come close to power. If he can’t afford not to live near criminals, he regards crime as _random_ and _natural_—like living in a lightning-infested neighborhood. He has never _once_ had the desire to _rule_ others, let alone acted on it—you’d be more likely to find a quokka killing sheep, for fun.

Yet at a certain level, he _does_ know there are foxes (blame colonialism). Aaronson says of his (non-polyamorous) time in the rationalist group house:

> The weird part is that I can’t remember taboo topics _ever_ being discussed at in-person meetups! I remember discussions of fluid mechanics and set theory and the Fermi paradox and covid, and a lot of puzzles and games.
> 
> All the same, there was an _immense_ amount of fear about being “outed” to news media with hostile intentions. Even knowing what we know today, it’s hard for me to say how much of that fear was a tragically self-fulfilling prophecy, and how much of it was simply prescient and correct.

An _immense_ amount. [“Quite an experience to live in fear, isn’t it?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zXajYDnprQ) Roy Batty knew. So do some of America’s sweetest, best, most innocent young scientists and engineers. Dear journalists: once you’re scaring the _quokkas_—how hard is it to see what you are?

## Fox school

One Aaronson point, which again most people agree with (and we must remember Churchill’s point, “nothing is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result”), is that in a way nothing happened here, because in the end no one was really hurt—Alexander dodged the bullet, and may even have profited from it—etc, etc. He writes:

> Yes, I’ve been bitten in the past, and it’s partly because I know how it feels that I spent so much time trying to prevent my friends from being bitten! In the end, though, these long-awaited bites seem fairly toothless, more rattle and hiss.

When we step up from quokka level 0 (total fearlessness) to quokka level 1 (pure fear), we do see some of these avoidant behaviors. At the level of pure fear, the quokka has _no idea why the fox is trying to hurt it_—it has no [theory of mind](https://www.simplypsychology.org/theory-of-mind.html) for the fox.

Actually the fox is not trying to hurt the quokka at all. It has no interest whatsoever in the quokka’s pain. It is just hungry. But what is the journalist trying to do? We’ll spend the rest of this post talking about that. But:

_**Q**_: If you are a quokka, and a _smart_ quokka at that, and you realize in a Bayesian sense that what happened here was (a) bad, (b) surprising and (c) could happen again, (d) not necessarily with the same result—how do you update your priors?

_**A**_: You need to go to _fox school_. You need to go to fox school not because the fox got you—but because the fox didn’t get you.

Fox school is not where a quokka learns to become a fox. This is not possible; a quokka is a quokka and will always be a quokka. Fox school is where quokkas learn how foxes think, so that they can avoid getting eaten by foxes.

I do sense that both Scotts are now firmly convinced that foxes are real. Still, neither of them seems to have a firm understanding of the behavior and motivations of the fox.

## A crash course in Lubyanka rationalism

The further we get into the 21st century, the more relevant the Imperium becomes—the more useful and important the fatal duality between the Eastern and Western narratives of progress. Yet the differences are just as important as the parallels. Here is an extremely broad historical generalization through which you can understand both.

While the _subjective perspective_ of the Western governing class could not be more different from that of the Eastern _apparat_, and the _structural form_ of the Western regime is also profoundly different, the _objective function_ of the two is remarkably convergent.

Therefore, one way to understand the Western regime is to first understand the Soviet regime—a period much less subject to perspective distortion—then understand how our own very different system achieves very similar ends, by very different means.

One feature of the Soviet regime, which Solzhenitsyn himself puzzled long at, was its meticulous insistence on a caricature of procedural jurisprudence within a blatantly arbitrary tyranny.

Why all the interrogations? Why is there even a [Lubyanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubyanka_Building)? If the regime has already decided you are guilty and need to be sent to Siberia—why does it care if you sign some ridiculous confession?

No one gets sent to the Lubyanka, tells some story which just _satisfies_ the KGB and convinces them that he didn’t work for British Intelligence, and is sent home with an apology and a free Soviet toaster-oven. No one.

Does even the KGB think all these people work for British Intelligence? How could it? The “K” in “KGB” doesn’t stand for “Stupid.” But if not, what is the functional purpose of this whole pseudo-judicial circus?

In fact, why doesn’t the KGB just _shoot_ all these unreliable people? When in doubt—why have a problem? Why not have _no_ problem? In certain periods, this is indeed the way. Solzhenitsyn gets in trouble (for an imprudent letter to a friend) at the end of the war, when things were more chill—but not _much_ more chill.

The purpose of the interrogation is simple. It is to _humiliate_ you into submission. This humiliation is a kind of _vaccination_; once you have humiliated yourself before power, you will never and can never recover your dignity. It was for exactly the same reason that the Roman authorities tortured Christians to death, when any martyr could have saved his own life at any moment—by worshiping the Emperor, and denying Christ.

This was generally true in the Spanish Inquisition, too—people were burned not for their beliefs, but for their dangerous obstinacy in refusing to publicly recant them. In other words: they were burned not for inner philosophy, but for outer politics. You don’t have to endorse _[de heretico comburendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_heretico_comburendo)_ to see how much more sense this makes.

But if your heretic _will_ recant? Why kill a man, when we could humiliate him? Power is in power; it _owns_ every man. Better dead than dangerous—better _useful_ than dead. But actually, no one can humiliate you—you have to humiliate _yourself_.

And if we take one of these intellectuals, these useful minds, and break his spirit so that he will always serve us—he becomes a piece of _herd immunity_. Not only can we use his talents—viruses check into him, and don’t check out. Whatever is left of his mind after he graduates from Room 101, he’ll be the buffer in any future solution.

Of course, Winston Smith in 1984 is left in exactly this state—if somewhat broken. But there was no shortage at all of top-notch Soviet scientists and engineers who served the Party in exactly the state of _immense fear_ that Scott Aaronson describes. (And like Scott, they even called themselves _progressives_.) Nor were they all lying! Or even most.

The thought police are not trying to hurt you! They are trying to _police_ you. Therefore, when they _fail_ to hurt you—you should not conclude that they have _failed_. Actually it is very likely that they succeeded, because they are professionals and you are an amateur.

Most people internalize fear. The normal reaction to fear is to normalize it into _fear of doing wrong_. So those we fear inherently seem righteous. It is human and inevitable to love, cherish and respect them: Stockholm or battered-wife syndrome.

The normal philosophical reaction to getting Gulaged was not rejecting Communism and all its works, and insisting that the Tsar did nothing wrong. It was trying to figure out how Communism had gone down the wrong track. In retrospect, of course, it is easy to see that once anyone’s historiography of the present commits to that direction, it has committed to searching a search space which is completely empty and very big.

But this sterile search space is superficially very attractive, because it resolves a major psychological problem: it allows us to rationalize our fear. The popularity of this trap convinces the opponents of power that it is a great place to lead their supporters into. They may still fail if they avoid it. They will certainly fail if they _enter_ it.

## How to humiliate yourself (#1, collaboration)

The #1 way to humiliate yourself is to cooperate with power against your old friends. After you’ve done this you can never have any self-respect again: full Judas. Even the legionary who tosses Judas the bag has no respect for Judas, and why should he? Not even cops like rats. There isn’t a truer scene in the Bible.

Power has many ways of taking this ultimate sacrifice. For example, dissidents are often low in the psychological trait called “agreeability,” and tend to fall out. It got airbrushed out of the Gospels, but even Jesus and his guys must have had some beefs—no one could possibly call Jesus “agreeable.”

And when you’re mad at someone, even your friends (who, like in high school, were your friends until Thursday and might well have been your friends again Tuesday), your mind naturally turns to using power against them. And in a tyranny, anyone who has a dime in his pocket has a lightning-bolt in his pocket. (And in a _non_\-tyranny, harmless and innocent people don’t live in “immense fear.”)

Since the entire principle of dissidence is denial of the regime’s mandate of heaven, any voluntary collaboration with power, for _any_ reason, humiliates the dissident. It creates a stain that will never rub off. (Voluntary collaboration is of course distinct from _legal compliance_, which is _especially super important_ for a dissident.)

The most common reason I see this done today is actually for what the cooperators think are _moral_ reasons; they think their brand of dissidence tastes better and is less filling, or something. Sorry, but this is retarded.

You are both _against_ the same thing—and, in the present state of society, nothing you could be _for_ would be worth a bucket of warm piss. As a dissident, you are nothing, you mean nothing and you are worth nothing. And the day you forget this is the day you become worth _less_ than nothing.

Yet we should not judge even these unfortunate wretches too harshly. The temptation and brutality of power is immense. While you can never again trust anyone who has cooperated with power in this morally fatal way, in certain cases you can forgive them—and you can always understand them, since there is nothing more human.

(Also, the _only_ thing worth doing to a rat is warning everyone he is a rat—and even _that_ is only worth doing if he has some existing reputation which would suggest otherwise. One of the many advantages of my “passivist” approach to dissidence, which eschews anything _remotely_ resembling “direct action”—from the Ayers or Alinsky school, all the way down to “civil disobedience”—is that it simply shouldn’t _matter_ whether every other person in the room is a fed, rat, etc—since not only is no one breaking any real laws, no one is even breaking any _fake_ laws. Despite how many of _those_ we have now.

The way to deal with rats around the house is the same: don’t have nothing they can eat, and you won’t have no rats. Or if you do—they will get bored, and leave. Ordinary people have many hobbies, but any serious dissident has only two: privacy hacking, and legal compliance. In both cases, the ordinary standard of citizenship is _not enough_.)

## How to humiliate yourself (#2, collateral)

The #2 way to humiliate yourself is, of course, to _love Big Brother_.

While I am convinced that the Scotts would pretty much literally _die_ before pulling a #1 (many such cases!), they sure do make up for it with #2. Fortunately, unlike #1, #2 is a venial sin that’s easy to just snap out of—well, _relatively_ easy.

And wasn’t #2 good enough for St. “I know not the man” Peter? Though apparently Peter was awful cut up about that, afterward. Still, it’s really important not to mistake Peter for Judas—or vice versa.

Now, you can’t just _say_ you love Big Brother. No one gets out of Room 101 that easily! You have to _show_ that you love him. The only way to do that is to give him your dignity. Big Brother is like Keith Raniere: he trusts you. But, he’ll still need some _collateral_.

In the Lubyanka or on Substack, you give Big Brother his collateral in the same way. You sign your name to his _lies_. As with #1, he has an almost innumerable arsenal of ways to convince you that this is a very good, important and/or necessary thing to do.

Long before Orwell, political scientists knew that words are one of the strongest tools of power. By using Big Brother’s newspeak, you prove that you know how to think like Big Brother. He can only properly be loved in his own language.

And the more strongly you commit to these lies—the more unconditional and absolute they are, the less convincing you make them—the deeper and sweeter your humiliation will be. The more you believe the lies, the more effectively you have been policed. And since you are human, the more you obey the lies, the more you come to believe them.

(Ketman is not even an option here—humiliating yourself is the opposite of ketman. Ketman is for _not_ getting detained, not for _after_ getting detained. Once in custody, just focus on not shitting the bed.)

The way to behave in the Lubyanka is to refuse the interrogator’s frame and insist on your own. What he is asking you to do is to contribute to the solidity of the official narrative—which is that everyone, _everyone_ loves Big Brother—by making it your own. Anyone can love Big Brother, even a foul worm like you! Let me assure you that once you _begin_ to love Big Brother—especially once he’s taken a _personal_ interest in you— you will very soon go all the way. At least: how often do you see anyone come _back?_

To refuse the frame is to never mouth power’s lies. Never accept its assumptions; never respect its authority; and above all, _never_ speak in its accursed _soixante-huitard_ jargon. If what you mean is “variety,” you can always say “variety.” And remember (both Scotts _are_ good at this) that silence is always an option.

Lies are handcuffs for your soul. This may be painful for quokkas and those who love them—but let’s watch Scott Alexander put his own cuffs on:

> The _Times_ also presented a more general case that I was a bad ally to women in tech. I deny this claim.

See that word _ally_?

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa84bb726-0311-4077-a2d2-692af0d054be_971x654.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa84bb726-0311-4077-a2d2-692af0d054be_971x654.png)

I deny this claim too. I deny that it is even _English_. I had to run to the bathroom twice, just from _pasting_ that word. I still don’t know what it means. I think my keyboard is clean now?

Think for a moment about all the assumptions a word like _ally_ drags into frame. For one thing, it is literally the language of _warfare…_ I don’t have to do this work for you.

> I have repeatedly blogged about studies suggesting that women are underrepresented in tech not because of explicit discrimination on the part of tech companies, but because women lose interest in tech very early, at least by high school (high school computer science classes are [something like 80% male](https://www.ncwit.org/infographic/3435), the same as big tech companies).

I have no idea why Scott thinks this makes a difference. It reminds me of the character in Todd Solondz’ _[Happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness_(1998_film))_ who explains that she’s not a _scab_—she’s a _strikebreaker_. “Losing interest” is just Scott’s own clever way to say “there is no conspiracy.” Also, of course, it’s perfectly true.

Of course there is no conspiracy. But why did you think you were in the Lubyanka in the first place? What did you think the Party had a problem with? Power doesn’t care about chromosomal psychometrics. Power cares about not being delegitimized.

When you tell the New Faith that there is no conspiracy, it is like telling Delta Force that there is no Taliban. First: there _is_ a Taliban. You can tell the Taliban because when you shoot at them, they shoot back. Second: there _needs_ to be a Taliban. Third: _who_ would say there is no Taliban? Who but—the Taliban?

> There is no evidence that women are inherently any less intelligent or any worse at math than men,

_No_ evidence.

In a sense, when the Eye of Sauron is on you, you are being interrogated by the _public_. Solzhenitsyn explains that in general, you should not lie to the interrogator—and not only by not repeating his own lies. A broader, truer and more Machiavellian way to put it is that lying is much harder than it seems; every lie you tell creates a surface area of mendacity that you have to permanently defend. And the interrogator takes notes.

Telling the interrogator’s lies puts you in his power; telling your own lies puts you in his power, if you get caught. Truth alone is your only firm ground in this contest. But it is particularly bad to tell his lies—he _knows_ they are lies, and can call you on it. In fact, he loves to trip you up this way.

Probably without any malice at all, an authentic prince of journalism, [Matthew Yglesias](https://www.slowboring.com/p/slate-star-codex)—it would be interesting to be able to compare Yglesias’ giant Substack grosses to Alexander’s—casually twists the knife, and completes the humiliation:

> In the (liberal, coastal, urban, very political) circles that I travel, everyone (especially parents) knows and acknowledges that men and women are, on average, different in ways that end up mattering for the distribution of outcomes. But everyone also believes that sexism and misogyny are significant problems in the world, and that the people struggling against those problems are worthy of admiration and praise.

Shorter Yglesias: we’re lying to you. In case you don’t think we believe our own lie, you’re right. We don’t. But we’re going to make _you_ believe this lie. We’re going to destroy your life if you don’t. We’re going to humiliate you by making you repeat it, then laugh at you because we don’t believe you. We’re doing this to you because we think it helps make the world a better place, and you’re expendable.

Exposing an innocent like Scott Alexander to this kind of concentrated, Borgia-tier journalistic cynicism really _is_ like exposing quokkas to the European fox _Vulpes Vulpes_. Our poor marsupial has no chance. Let’s finish with this paragraph of Alexander’s:

> and I have tried to make this very clear in all of my posts on the subject—for example in the [Contra Grant](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/07/contra-grant-on-exaggerated-differences/) post linked above, where I say, quote, “My research suggests no average gender difference in ability”.

I was curious about this. I thought I remembered having read this Scott Alexander poast. (I read most of them—not so much the _fiction_.) I did not remember him doing any of this St. Peter stuff. So I went to the tape. My memory was sort of right and sort of wrong. The full context:

> Grant claims that there are no sex differences in mathematical ability, and also that the sex differences in mathematical ability are culturally determined. I’m not really sure what he means \[EDIT: He means sex differences that exist in other countries\] but I agree with his first argument—at the levels we’re looking at, there’s no gender difference in math ability.
> 
> Grant says that these foreign differences in math ability exist but are due to stereotypes, and so are less noticeable in more progressive, gender-equitable nations. Again, my research suggests no average gender difference in ability, so I can’t speak to whether these differences are caused by stereotypes or not.

His _research?_ Scott Alexander is a careful and scientific thinker. But there is no link here. Also note the beautiful ambiguity of “suggests no”—which could mean either of “suggests that there is no” or “does not suggest that there is a”—two _entirely_ different scientific claims.

I checked whether “Again” could refer to anything else above. It clearly refers to the first paragraph. I think the secret is “at the levels we’re looking at”—as Scott knows very well, small population differences are magnified at the extremes, and obscured at the medians. I can’t see what _else_ he could possibly mean.

One way of making stuff up is to play a game of telephone with yourself. You can work backward from “at the levels,” through “suggests no,” to Scott’s denial, beneath a photo of Walter Duranty, that he ever even _heard_ of this “Jesus” asshole.

Now, what Scott is doing in this “Grant” post is very clever, and we should admire it. He is both debunking a work of arrant pseudoscience, and making a true, important, and dangerous point about the world—that statistical data of the sort generally used, by the Grants of the world, to prove the existence of the vast anti-woman conspiracy and their war on women, an axis of evil we must all “ally” against—as if we lived in a life-sized _comic book_, a caped-crusader cartoon for nine-year-olds—is entirely invalid. And he is doing this _without even using_ the common, obvious [Larry Summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers) argument. His statistical evasions are just pro forma excuses for passing by this minefield path.

And all of this intricate logical macrame is completely useless. Scott’s enemies can see through his evasions. They know he hasn’t done any of this “research.” Ruthless and predatory foxes that they are, all they see when they see a pattern of evasion is meat that knows it’s good to eat—meat that’s humiliating itself out of fear. The tastiest, most satisfying quokka is always the quokka that thought it could run away.

And while virgin Scott is handcuffing himself 17 times over with progressive theology, his Substack rival Yglesias, the _chad_, just strolls right past and _says the unsayable_. And this story has a happy ending: _neither of them gets suspended from Substack_. So far!

I hate to be an optimist, but—maybe, after the fall of the Trumpenreich, we _don’t_ have to live in fear? Dare we dream? I’ve been so harsh on Scott Alexander in this segment that I should give him the last word. From further down in the “Grant” post:

> Silicon Valley was supposed to be better than this. It was supposed to be the life of the mind, where people who were interested in the mysteries of computation and cognition could get together and make the world better for everybody. Now it’s degenerated into this giant hatefest of everybody writing long screeds calling everyone else Nazis and demanding violence against them.

Where the idea that we _shouldn’t_ be a surveillance society where we carefully watch our coworkers for signs of sexism so we can report them to the authorities is exactly the sort of thing you get reported to the authorities if people see you saying.

As Trent Reznor once put it: you were up above it. But now you’re [down in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrrEo3hZABU). In the end, Scott—aren’t we all down in it?

## How to humiliate yourself (#3, confrontation)

The #3 way to humiliate yourself, unfortunately, is what everyone thinks is the way to _not_ humiliate yourself: _confrontation_.

The Polish writer Aleksandr Wat once got caught up in some roundup and wound up in a transport to Siberia. Everyone in the train was in for the same thing: anti-Soviet activity. Specifically: forming an anti-Soviet counterrevolutionary organization.

Of course it turned out that no one had done _any_ such thing—_except_ one sixteen-year-old kid, who had _actually_ formed an anti-Soviet counterrevolutionary organization. This organization had consisted of: him; his best friend; and another kid in gym class. Many rueful laughs were had at the expense of this poor kid. Don’t be him, though.

I have heard a lot of ideas for confronting the press. And like everyone else, I have seen the stupid version of actually _doing_ it—“Gamergate.” Some believe there is a harmless, smart, effective version of Gamergate. I don’t agree with them and let me tell you why.

Unfortunately, there are a few signs that even the Scotts are heading reluctantly in this direction. For instance, this from Alexander is mildly confrontational:

> I believe they misrepresented me as retaliation for my publicly objecting to their policy of doxxing bloggers in a way that threatens their livelihood and safety. Because they are much more powerful than I am and have a much wider reach, far more people will read their article than will read my response, so probably their plan will work.

Aaronson, having spent _hours_ on the phone with the reporter (please remember that I have made all these mistakes _myself!_) muses about the possibility that the reporter himself, who seemed like a _good guy_ (Q: do they ever not? A: not at this level), was overruled by his sinister nameless _editors…_

The reality is that the reporter is a good guy, just weak. The editors are good guys, just weak. The problem with the _New York Times_ isn’t the _people_. I admit that some of them are monsters—even they were not born monsters. Moloch made them monsters. The problem is always [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)—the system, not the people. My fellow Brown alumnus, [AG Sulzberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._G._Sulzberger)? I’m pretty darn sure he’s a good guy, just weak. In fact, I’ve never met a journalist I didn’t get along with—and I’ve met too many for my own good.

Of course, people are morally responsible for their crimes of weakness. But while none of this confrontational thinking is exactly _wrong_, it bespeaks an erroneous theory of the fox. Even at this level of advanced thinking, the fox is still being modeled as a quokka.

But now it is an _enraged_ quokka; or an evil quokka, a scheming Machiavellian quokka, a quokka with a _plan_. We must raise the quokka armies of the “Dark Enlightenment” to fight back against Darth Quaker, the evil, black, 5-foot-tall Death Quokka, recently named Hereditary Lord Publisher V of the Mordor Times…

I may look like a Whitesnake roadie, but I’m almost fifty years old. I have _polyps_ in my colon—big _red_ things, like _tomatoes_. I’m not here for _capeshit_. If this fiasco has taught me anything, it is that most people, once they are finally convinced to care about power, think about it in terms of capeshit. Which is utterly useless, when it isn’t being extremely counterproductive.

Let’s think very concretely about the idea of fighting back against the press. Let’s take the best possible version of this idea—the _steelman_ version—and assume that, as we fight back against the press, we strictly obey _all_ the Geneva Conventions—following the most rigid and orthodox traditions of journalism, as we investigate journalism.

Surely no one can invent a better and milder version of _confrontation_ than this. Well, I can’t, anyway. So if I can prove that even _this_ confrontation is a bad idea, I disprove all the others _a fortiori_.

I think even most _journalists_ would say this is fine. Maybe it’s fine. I don’t know. And I certainly wouldn’t _condemn_ it. But I still think it’s a bad idea. Essentially, the press is part of the government, and you can’t replace just part of the government—especially not its most powerful, important part. Free speech failed. We just refuse to admit it.

But that’s a very abstract objection to confronting the press (using both the tools and the rules of the press). Is this _really_ a bad idea? It could be a bad idea in two ways. One, it could be a _morally_ bad idea. Two, it could be a _tactically_ bad idea. As we’ll see, one out of two is enough.

To be very specific: the idea that it is in some sense _immoral_ to scrutinize the press, in the same way and with the same tools that it scrutinizes _us_, can be examined in two moral contexts. It can be examined within the _relative_ moral context of the American legal tradition—in which the First Amendment does not distinguish between classes of private citizen—or the _absolute_ moral context of Machiavellian political science, in which might makes right and the only test of legitimacy is power itself. From either angle, it does not pass the laugh test.

Arguments like this always make me think of one of the great political pamphlets of the Anglo-American tradition, Daniel Defoe’s _Shortest-Way With the Dissenters_—for which Defoe actually went to _jail_, a dissident achievement I have yet to unlock—which begins with this amazing fable:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab9d2037-266b-410f-9f16-ae554d1359c6_733x706.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab9d2037-266b-410f-9f16-ae554d1359c6_733x706.png)

The rooster used to roost on a rack above the horses. So he shit all over them, all the time. But one day the rack was being cleaned, or something—and the rooster had to sleep on some hay on the floor. So he kept being like: “Hey guys! Let’s not step on each other!” (BTW, getting really into [Roger L’Estrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_L%27Estrange) might be a fun project for someone.)

To hear “hey guys! Let’s not step on each other!,” from the American _press_, is the most astounding earthquake of pure _chutzpah_ the hemisphere has seen since the Pacific Plate broke off the Plate of Juan de Fuca, 150 million years ago, creating what we now call “Canada”—certain astronomers theorize that some sort of interstellar chutzpah _comet_ may have crashed into the earth—this was not quite like _that_—but _close—_

As Scott Alexander put it: “please don’t kick me in the balls.” Yes—we _do_ know what it means to live in fear. Yes—we no longer wish to live in fear. Does this _surprise_ you? Honestly, what surprises me is that people like the Scotts can even _say_ it. And while I hope they don’t stop saying it—I honestly expect that they _will_. It’s just human nature.

So all the laws of God and man concur that if the only way—or even the best way, or even one way—for us to _stop_ living in fear, was for them to _start_ living in fear, justice would be satisfied. “Quite an experience, isn’t it—to live in fear.” And _yet_:

It’s not the only way. It’s not the best way. It’s not even _one_ way. _Confrontation_, of this or any kind, _actually does not work at all_.

The first reason confrontation doesn’t work is the same reason it’s harmless. An army of quokkas is still an army of quokkas. In a “democracy,” there is a magical tendency to believe in the _power of numbers_. But actually, any number of quokkas is harmless. In reality, numbers only matter for rough and rowdy men—

This principle of crowd power through bottom-up swarming tactics has a name. It’s called “democracy.” In fact, “democracy” literally _means_ “crowd power.” Were you wondering how I could think democracy sucks? Wonder no more! People who like it just take something _else_ they like, and call _that_ “democracy.” If you find this shocking—did you know that humans evolved from _apes?_

Democracy still sucks. History tells us to never rule it out. History also tells us that true democratic power appears only rarely, under rare circumstances—and none of those circumstances seems realistic in the present world.

Gamergate did get rowdy—by 21st-century American standards. Gamers did gamer things—they are a crude and barbaric people. Next to the Visigoths, they are quokkas. Next to the quokkas they are terrifying. Gamers will order you an unwanted pizza, etc, without thinking twice about it. And there are always one or two unhinged maniacs who will stoop to genuinely dangerous stuff, “swatting” or the like.

Still, we’re not exactly looking at Alaric here. No one can organize gamers. Part of what made Gamergate so terrifying to the Party was this completely unorganized nature—it had no center to kill. But this same unorganized—and _unorganizable_—nature created not an army, but a ragtag peasant horde—which could not even survive the ravages of time, let alone twenty or thirty well-trained knights of journalism.

Let’s go back to our steelman tactics and imagine the best possible version of this—or at least, the best possible version that can be made of quokkas. Our war quokkas will be _counter-journalists—_at least as talented, trained and disciplined as their enemies—dedicated to the _merciless and total destruction_ of the legacy press.

We’ll divide these intellectual soldiers into two armies. One army will _counter_ the press—replying to _every one_ of their tweets with laser-sharp facts, logic, and wit. The other army will _investigate_ the press—emptying their trashcans, where permitted by law, to winkle out all their nefarious conspiracies and derring-do.

Again, there’s nothing hugely wrong with this. But it is one of these ideas that seems big in a vacuum, but deflates rapidly upon examination. Part of this is the result of converting the hyperbolic language of abstraction into the clear language of action.

One trope that I think we’ve learned a lot about in 2021 is combative hyperbole. Let’s be very clear. For any kind of a dissident, combative hyperbole is _not_ ok. Yes—it’s ok for _them_. But not for _you_. You are not at _war_. You are not _fighting_. You are not—well, take anything like this that Trump or Biden might say. Biden can say it. Trump can’t. And you can’t, either. _Quod licet jovi, non licet bovi_.

Why does confrontation not work? Because you are confronting enemies who are far stronger than you. Also, the confrontation depletes your energy and restores theirs. _Your_ threats are empty gestures; _their_ threats are real. I believe we’ve seen this pattern play out in a number of contexts across this superb and amazing year of our history.

Confrontation feeds their energy because it convinces them of their favorite fantasy: that, on behalf of the weak and helpless, they are fighting an uphill battle against the evil and strong. None of this is true. It is complete bullshit. They are power whores who are lying to themselves. They will not recover until their junk supply is cut off. And you are not helping _anything_ by helping them to convince themselves of this lie.

Confrontation drains your energy because you are _doing_ work, but not _accomplishing_ anything. If you were not a quokka subreddit but an Acapulco narco cartel, perhaps you would be “attriting” (in Pentagonese) the NYT news desk. _First_: if my aunt had balls, she’d be my uncle. _Second_: this process doesn’t seem to have worked out super well for Acapulco. _Third_: the NYT could _turn over_ their whole news desk _two or three times a year_, in gruesome narco _casualties_—and probably _still_ have no trouble hiring.

Confrontation does pump up your team—temporarily. It is not creating power. It is borrowing it. If the power is wasted, as it will be, you experience a debt on the other end—a debt called _[learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness)_. For example: where is the “Tea Party” now? Answer: they burned all their gas on stupid posturing, ran out of gas and disappeared.

Finally, confrontation produces _useless coalitions_ which are broad and shallow. A useless coalition is any group of people who could not unite in any cohesive purpose. Typically they have not sacrificed or committed anything to the group—they don’t even fund it.

If you have a large number of people in a group that matches this description, and you need a group that can actually perform some useful collective action, your most effective path will probably be to disband your existing group and form a new one.

Also, while building a useless coalition, you will find that to get the most people, you have to keep your ideas as familiar as possible—which means you’ll be generating a _lot_ of collateral (as in, humiliation ritual #2).

Strategically, therefore, it is _the strong_ who should seek confrontation—and _the weak_ who should seek peace. This is why I was not at all hostile to the NYT interrogator assigned to Scott’s case, and in general try my best to _never_ be hostile to journalists—however awful they are to me, individually or collectively.

Why would anyone want to be hostile to the people who really matter? What? Also, reminder—they still have to be the people they are. Speaking as an atheist: it is God’s job to punish them, not yours or mine. Moreover: in general, the probability of any regime change is proportional to how well the transition treats the old ruling class.

And how _is_ that old ruling class, anyway? Is it happy? Surely the ruling class itself is always happy? Lol. Fact: in an oligarchy, the ruling class is almost never happy. Now, let’s face it: to paraphrase that great old Irish film, _[The Commitments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commitments_(film))_, the New York Post is the n-word of newspapers. But according to an internal New York _Times_ survey they claim to have “obtained,” _[half of the staff is afraid of the other half](https://nypost.com/2021/02/13/new-york-times-employees-feel-they-cant-speak-freely-survey/)_.

(And did you think it was different, in Yagoda’s time? In Dzerzhinsky’s, even? Maybe the _real_ evil plan would just be to smuggle a bunch of _machetes_ into the building, and let the journalists _themselves_ do all the work. Alas—I fear the wrong side would win.)

It is true that this regime is totally unacceptable. It is hardly the only unacceptable regime in history. Some of which have lasted for centuries, so it’s hard to be too chill about this kind of stuff. When will it end? Speaking as an atheist: God will decide.

Also, from a Bayesian perspective, when you notice that a regime is unacceptable, there are are always two possibilities: (a) it just _became_ unacceptable; (b) it had been unacceptable since God knows when—but you just _noticed_. Saith the good Rev. Bayes: when in doubt, go with (b).

Also, from a Bayesian perspective, when you notice that a regime is unacceptable, there are always two possibilities: (a) it _can_ be fixed; (b) it needs to be _replaced_. Once again the Reverend always puts his chips on (b).

Next, you’ll notice that the things you would do to fix the regime are almost always completely different from the things you would do to replace the regime, _even from the very first step_.

## The grand strategy of the war quokka: peace

You actually cannot replace a regime. You can only convince it to replace itself. How do you think the Soviet Union fell? Alas, Trump missed his chance to be our Yeltsin. Maybe he should have been a drinker after all.

Quokkas are terrible at coups. They can be pretty convincing, though. Look at that little guy’s smile! Even if the quokka is at war—he is a _war_ quokka—he can fight only as what he is, which is a quokka. He must fight with the weapons of the quokka.

The quokka’s enemy is the fox—_Vulpes vulpes._ The fox’s first instinct is just to _eat_ him. The quokka cannot even _imagine_ killing the fox and has in fact never killed anything bigger than a _grub_—which was _icky_, too—quokka food is, like, _seeds—_or whatever—it sure isn’t _foxes—_so the relationship is inherently asymmetric.

Therefore, as a quokka, you have only one option: to _tame_ the fox. In real life I’m pretty sure that foxes, being genetically superior placental mammals, are much smarter than quokkas. In the analogy, as a war quokka, your only weapon is your big quokka brain.

Therefore, your only practical strategy is a strategy of _peace_. Your goal as a dissident is the _exact opposite_ of confrontation. Your goal is to promote, both through your actions and your rhetoric, the physical and spiritual attitude of _peacetime_. If you are creating a community, the product of that community is _peace_.

Peace was always the selling point of _Slate Star Codex_—and let us hope that Scott can recreate that. (I would recommend limiting comment privileges to paid subscribers.)

## Enter the mind of the fox

Your enemy is the fox. Your only weapon is your mind. Real samurai hours:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff11afa54-725c-4d3a-b873-d1d665e76774_887x503.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff11afa54-725c-4d3a-b873-d1d665e76774_887x503.png)

If you want to beat the fox, you have to _tame_ the fox. If you want to tame the fox, you have to _know_ the fox. Not only do you have to understand the fox better than it understands you—you have to understand it better than it understands itself.

This is a high bar. We have already been in “fox school”—doing the prerequisites, which just means doing my best to help you clear your quokka mind of all the usual quokka misconceptions about foxes. Hopefully this worked. “Prep” always matters.

But I am not a fox. Fox school means you learn how foxes think, from foxes. Here is a reading list of essays by foxes, about being foxes, written for a vulpine audience: by [Freddie DeBoer](https://fredrikdeboer.com/2021/02/15/scott-alexander-is-not-in-the-gizmodo-media-slack/) (ex Jacobin), [Elizabeth Spiers](https://mynewbandis.substack.com/p/slate-star-clusterfuck) (ex Gawker), [Hamilton Nolan](https://www.cjr.org/public_editor/washington-post-tesla-trump-power.php) (ex Gawker), and [Nellie Bowles](https://chosenbychoice.substack.com/p/learning-how-to-and-how-not-to-kill) (ex NYT).

I know foxes well enough to know that all these essays are completely sincere, or close enough. You should not take everything in them as objectively correct assessments of reality. You _should_ take everything in them as subjectively valid self-reports.

The fundamental equation which unites all these writers—though they have different takes on this reality—is the nature of journalism as the ichor of power in the world. And for tech quokkas, there is not a _single_ technical change in the last 150 years that has changed this reality—except to accentuate it.

If four essays is too long for you (what, you don’t think you need fox school?), here are some clips from each. Bear in mind that each of these descriptions is a perfectly true and correct subjective description, by a legitimate expert, of the same objective reality.

DeBoer:

> You have to understand: most writers are losers, or at least, they secretly think of themselves as losers. They were losers in high school and never got over it and were surprised to learn that they couldn’t get their novel about Facing Adulthood with My Multiracial Friends in Bushwick published and so didn’t get the literary celebrity they felt they deserved. So they dive into the media ecosystem where they are delighted to find exactly what they were looking for: a new high school, a replacement for the one where they were a fucking loser, where this time _they’ll_ be the quarterback, they’ll be the head cheerleader. And so they get up every morning and jockey for rank. They horse trade. They seek favor. They amplify work they don’t really respect because the person who wrote it is more popular or successful than them or both. They pretend that terrible, terrible jokes told by terminally unfunny people are entertaining, because they know the other person will reciprocate.
> 
> Anyone with the audacity to write from outside of that world is a target.

Yeah sure. The problem with DeBoer’s text is that he is telling us what foxes _are_, not how they _see_ themselves. Of course this is what they are. But it’s not what we need.

Spiers is a much more useful fox:

> They are not out to destroy the site, or “get” Scott, or punish him. At the risk of puncturing egos: they are not thinking about Scott or the site at all. Even the reporter working on the story has no especial investment in its subject. That reporter is also probably working on six other stories at the same time, thinking about their friends, family, what their kid needs to do in Zoom school tomorrow, the book they want to read, whether Donald Trump will get arrested, whether rats dream of boredom. They do not sit around thinking about how they’re going to “get” people they write about, and when subjects think they do, it’s more a reflection of the subject’s self-perception (or self-importance) and, sometimes, a sprinkling of unadulterated narcissism. 

This is also true. But it turns out that when you kick people in the balls, they often have a response that strikes you as “self-important.” At least, if you’re a _sociopath_.

Spiers’ reaction also reminds us of the equally valid perspective of [Bison from Street Fighter](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday). “For me, it was _Tuesday_.” Which does not exactly seem a point in her _defense_, _n’est ce pas_—or that of her profession? [Nice people](https://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-Men-Reserve-Battalion-Solution/dp/0060995068) are often professional sociopaths.

The correct way to read the Spiers post is in reverse. Go to the bottom, where she reveals the kind of juvenile, cliched emotional _boilerplate_ that makes an 44-year-old fox support the Party—and feel just this completely, emotionally, morally _numb_ as she graces village after village, Tuesday after Tuesday, kicking people like Scott in the balls to get another huge shot of power-heroin in the arm.

I won’t copy this kind of _trash_ into my blog, but you know the flavor:

> Slowly, I began to believe that justice issues matter and affect everything. I never thought of myself as privileged—

Ms. Spiers, this country is a _wreck_ and everyone knows it. And everyone who has seen pictures of America before _your revolution_ got ahold of it knows _whose fault_ that is.

And if, for some reason I _cannot even fathom_, you feel some special ownership of “Black” people (love the majuscule! Will you try to have me arrested if I don’t use it?), I refer you to [Glenn Loury](https://glennloury.substack.com/), an actual “Black” person and a real social scientist (at my alma mater, Brown), who can easily show you how all the objective socioeconomic statistics of that community have been heading for _Hades_ since 1965, ie, since your New Faith showed us how to do everything _right_—in case your own eyes have not seen the ruin of every historic “Black” community in the country. Which I guess would make sense if you don’t leave the Village much. Any other _policy wins_ to brag about today? Are we _race-obsessed_ enough yet? Or do we need more _diversity training?_ It’s not just the nerds you’ve terrorized, but the country, even the world—for _this_ wasteland? In the bowels of God, I beseech you—_think it possible you might be mistaken_.

Moreover, when you connect this boilerplate (which, even though it is on an Eat, Pray, Love level in terms of sheer cliche power, you clearly feel a strong emotional link to), to your utter, dismaying numbness in the face of the lives you professionally destroy, you are protesting too much. These are clearly two forms of empathy—one of which is pathological, and has entirely displaced the other. Physician: heal thyself. Also, I think, less pinot grigio.

The Spiers text is the most valuable of the four, because it reveals the whole emotional pathway to cruelty. The Scotts can’t quite figure out how these human beings, who seem so warm and empathic in person, can be so _cruel_ in print. Certainly, part of it has to do with the editors, and with the machine in general—but basically everyone inside the machine believes in the machine. (Often even when they claim not to, I think.)

The journalist is actually acting on two stages: a _personal_ stage and a _political_ stage. As Ms. Spiers admits, in her actions on the _personal_ stage, the fox is completely numb—as cold as any Gulag boss to the “items” on her desk. In Japan’s notorious [Unit 731](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731) biowarfare center, sited in Manchuria because of the supply of cheap Manchurians, the human test subjects were referred to as _maruta_, or “logs.”

But all this petty human cruelty is more than compensated—like a _carbon_ offset—by the _political_ value of the work. Here Ms. Spiers’ prose lights up, loses its catty and sadistic tone, and soars to the poetic heights of a Hallmark card, a Hustler caption or an Olive Garden commercial. This is the true mind of the normal, midwit, American journalist—a breed Ms. Spiers is certainly on the upper end of.

At least Elizabeth Spiers only _founded_ Gawker. Hamilton Nolan actually _worked_ there:

> Because journalism, particularly at the highest level, is about raw power. It is about bringing important people to heel, on behalf of the public.
> 
> All I know is that there is only one way the press maintains its power in society: by metaphorically putting the heads of powerful people on pikes. If the _Post_ and all the other respectable media outlets lose their ability to do that, powerful people will, by extension, stop caring what the well-informed segment of the public thinks.

You will see this mindset in _everyone_ who has power. Bison does not really even see himself as _powerful_. No! He sees himself as _restraining_ all the _other_ bosses. Which is, of course, a completely valid subjective perspective.

“Well-informed segment of the public” is especially rich. Oligarchy much? Democracy is always and everywhere a game of three-card monte. If you want to know when the public’s mind is _sacred_ and when it’s _evil_, start training yourself not to _blink_.

Gawker was actually _good_, because it did this so often—saying the quiet part out loud. It’s easy to see how quickly and easily we can segue from the soppy NPR homilies of Ms. Spiers, bland and mushy Unitarian stuff, to the wild, Nietzschean power trips of Mr. Nolan—which come out sounding like if Bronze Age Pervert was a journalist. Do tell us more about that red lightsaber, young Jedi!

Finally, before I forget that my goal here was to make you feel _good_ about journalists, Nellie Bowles of the Times—perhaps coincidentally, the best writer of the four—reminds us that humanity springs eternal and redemption is always possible:

> Stirring outrage can be good. It can very well be the right thing to do. I won an award for working on an investigation series into predators using social video games to groom children. I’m glad that series made people mad.
> 
> But it’s extremely hard to control this tool. I would other times thrust a massive spotlight onto a person who would suffer from it and for no good reason. As an intern at the Chronicle, I got a man fired because he talked to me for a story, and some part of me knew it would happen. The story was a completely silly one, about private women’s clubs in the city, and he was a sweet and gentle man. I still feel sick when I think about him. And I think about him a lot.
> 
> In becoming increasingly driven by the pleasure of attention and conflict, I was sharpening my cruelest edges. The roar of Twitter on my side meant the kill was justified and good. I was using the tools that had been gifted to me—my love of people, my ability to write—but pursuing only attention, which is just the affection of the mob.
> 
> I do not want to cultivate sociopathy in myself. And cultivating sociopathy was exactly what I was doing.

Downside: apparently this level of enlightenment involves some kind of Jewish _ritual bath_—aaand, that’s only for the _women_. (Also, I’ll be surprised if we see a Bowles byline at the Times again. It’s not the _institutions_ that can reform.)

## Journalism for quokkas

Did you learn something here, my lovely fellow quokkas? I would be very disappointed if you did not.

I thought a good thought to leave you with would be another of Scott Aaronson’s best paragraphs. (Frankly, Dr. Aaronson is wasted on quantum computing—which will _never_ work—when is he going to admit it, give up his grants, and start a Substack?)

> The trouble with the NYT piece is not that it makes any false statements, but just that it constantly _insinuates_ nefarious beliefs and motives, via strategic word choices and omission of relevant facts that change the emotional coloration of the facts that it _does_ present. I repeatedly muttered to myself, as I read: “dude, you could make _anything_ sound shady with this exact same rhetorical toolkit!”

Indeed. And basically, _everything else you know_—you got from the same place.
